# Snake_game
## Project Description
- This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the Python Turtle module

## Installation
- To play this game, you'll need to have Python 3 and the Turtle module installed on your computer. You can download Python from the official website, and the Turtle module is included with the most Python installations.

## How to Play
- To start the game, simply run the 'snake_game.py' file in your Python environment. Use the arrow keys on the keyboard to move the snake around the screen, and try to eat as many food items as you can without running into the walls or the snake's own body.

As you collect food items, your score will increase. The game will also get progressively harder as the snake gets longer, so be careful!

## Features 
- Simple and easy to play
- Score system to track your progress

## Credits 
The game was created by Thapelo Magqazana.
